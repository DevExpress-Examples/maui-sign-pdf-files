# Use Office File API to Draw a Signature and Sign a PDF File

This project uses the [.NET MAUI Community Toolkit DrawingView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/maui/views/drawingview#using-the-drawingview) to display a signature pad. This pad allows you to draw your signature and place it in the specified PDF document. After the file is signed, the application shares this file with other applications.
